# When indexing a large continuous file that grows very large, a universal
# or light forwarder may become "stuck" on one indexer, trying to reach 
# EOF before being able to switch to another indexer. The symptoms of this
# are congestion on *one* indexer in the pool while others seem idle, and
# possibly uneven loading of the disk usage for the target index.
# In this instance, forceTimebasedAutoLB can help!
# ** Do not enable if you have events > 64kB **

# It's OK to have a tcpout group like the one above *with* a server list;
