For more information on this detection in general, check out the great blog post specifically about this detection by Splunk's own Andrew Dauria (<a href=\"https://www.splunk.com/blog/2018/01/17/finding-new-evil-detecting-new-domains-with-splunk.html\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>).",

For any environments/systems that are involved in processing personal data, this situation can be critical, and especially so in a GDPR context. <b>Article 32</b> of the GDPR requires that organizations regularly test, assess and evaluate effectiveness of implemented technical and organizational security controls. In the event that a Supervisory Authority executes powers to place an organization within the scope of a privacy audit, the organization must demonstrate compliance (<b>Article 58</b>). If the organization faces a personal data breach and individuals are impacted, those individuals have the right to demand compensation for material and non-material damage caused by the breach. The organization must prove that they have understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (<b>Article 82</b>). </p><h4>Resolution Path</h4><p>Removing malware infections that antivirus and other legacy endpoint protection software cannot remove (whether due to file permissions or other configurations that prevents easy quarantine or cleaning) can be considered in many cases appropriate, and helps to demonstrate compliance</p>.",

These regulations also specify that a mechanism exist to notify when critical systems stop forwarding event data. For example, tracking of \u201cinitialization, stopping, or pausing of audit logs\u201d. This is directly related to the fact that commonly, the intent behind disruption to event data forwarding is malicious, e.g. an attempt to evade a preventive measure or to avoid detection. </p><h4>Impact:</h4><p>The GDPR requires that organizations collect the full audit trail of data processing activities of involved systems and applications. This can impact the organization via a wide array of GDPR articles. If breached, Article 33 requires organizations to inform the authorities, including details about the nature of the breach, such as how many individuals have been affected. The same requirement is in Article 34 for when organizations must identify which individuals are affected, in order to notify them if there is a high risk related to their individual data. If organizations do not store the requisite logs and are therefore not able to proper scope the impact, data privacy officers will need to assume the worst case scenario: all personal data that was stored or processed in the breached environment or accessible by the breached user was affected. In addition, Article 32 requires implementation of proper security controls, and for organizations to monitor, test, and demonstrate their effectiveness. If an organization experiences that logging stops for a particular host or set of hosts, then the organization will not be able to prove the status and effectiveness of the applied security controls on those systems, in the event of damage claims (Article 82) or privacy audits (Article 58). If the organization lacks host logs and corresponding application logs, they will not be able to prove which records have been processed, such as proving that a record was deleted according to an individual's delete request (Article 17) or proving compliance with a processing restriction requested by an individual (Article 18 and Article 21).

Ensure that those assets are configured properly to report logging activity to an appropriate central repository. Monitor for changes in logging status, adjust for known outages, and prioritize incident response for any failures to report by hosts that are not scheduled for downtime.</p>",

The second is to leverage just the numerical risk scores defined in the Risk Framework to show users who have bursty recent risk scores or consistent long term risk.

If you use a different internal wiki (like Sharepoint), then you will need to alter the search to pull the search logs for that system. The second piece is harder -- in order to find project code names being searched in your logs, you have to know what those code names are (and for this detection, what department they belong to). You will have to reach out to different departments in your organization to find this knowledge, but once you have it you can mirror the format of the sample sse_project_codenames lookup.</p>",

The \"deviation_threshold\" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The \"minimum_data_samples\" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host.

We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The \"deviation_threshold\" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The \"minimum_data_samples\" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host.

These regulations also specify that a mechanism exist to notify when critical systems stop forwarding event data. For example, tracking of \u201cinitialization, stopping, or pausing of audit logs\u201d. This is directly related to the fact that commonly, the intent behind disruption to event data forwarding is malicious, e.g. an attempt to evade a preventive measure or to avoid detection. </p><h4>Impact:</h4><p>The GDPR requires that organizations collect the full audit trail of data processing activities of involved systems and applications. This can impact the organization via a wide array of GDPR articles. If breached, Article 33 requires organizations to inform the authorities, including details about the nature of the breach, such as how many individuals have been affected. The same requirement is in Article 34 for when organizations must identify which individuals are affected, in order to notify them if there is a high risk related to their individual data. If organizations do not store the requisite logs and are therefore not able to proper scope the impact, data privacy officers will need to assume the worst case scenario: all personal data that was stored or processed in the breached environment or accessible by the breached user was affected. In addition, Article 32 requires implementation of proper security controls, and for organizations to monitor, test, and demonstrate their effectiveness. If an organization experiences that logging stops for a particular host or set of hosts, then the organization will not be able to prove the status and effectiveness of the applied security controls on those systems, in the event of damage claims (Article 82) or privacy audits (Article 58). If the organization lacks host logs and corresponding application logs, they will not be able to prove which records have been processed, such as proving that a record was deleted according to an individual's delete request (Article 17) or proving compliance with a processing restriction requested by an individual (Article 18 and Article 21). If a host does not report event data, a processor cannot prove that only authorized individuals have accessed the data (Article 28).</p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p>Identify all GDPR-relevant IT assets from the data mapping exercise conducted by the Data Privacy Officer\u2019s team -- that is, all IT assets that are relevant to the full audit trail of data processing activities. This includes not only data stores and repositories that house sensitive PD / PII, but also any technologies that are involved in the processing, storage, transmission, receipt, rendering, encrypt/decrypt, relaying, and any other function that involves handling that data in any capacity. Ensure that those assets are configured properly to report logging activity to an appropriate central repository. Monitor for changes in logging status, adjust for known outages, and prioritize incident response for any failures to report by hosts that are not scheduled for downtime.</p>",

For any environments/systems that are involved in processing personal data, this situation can be critical, and especially so in a GDPR context. Article 32 of the GDPR requires that organizations regularly test, assess and evaluate effectiveness of implemented technical and organizational security controls.

If the organization faces a personal data breach and individuals are impacted, those individuals have the right to demand compensation for material and non-material damage caused by the breach. The organization must prove that they have understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (Article 82). </p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p> Removing malware infections that antivirus and other legacy endpoint protection software cannot remove (whether due to file permissions or other configurations that prevents easy quarantine or cleaning) can be considered in many cases appropriate, and helps to demonstrate compliance.</p>",

The organization must prove that they have understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (Article 82). </p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p>Removing malware infections that antivirus and other legacy endpoint protection software cannot remove (whether due to file permissions or other configurations that prevents easy quarantine or cleaning) can be considered in many cases appropriate, and helps to demonstrate compliance.</p>",

Some users may even leave a stock website up all day (or leverage widgets that track stock access). The goal is to set the bar high enough that anyone who triggers this particular rule is spending lots of time trading, with traffic to a number of different sites.</p><p>To build the rule, we looked at an organization that did not have any known day trading behavior -- we looked for users who had large amount of trading-related activities, and looked at what a heavy versus light hour was, to try to determine what it would look like when a user was focused on this. However, because we don't have a few bad users to make sure we would detect the right or wrong things, we can't say with confidence that we have exactly the right patterns. That said, this should be a good foundation. If you have the opportunity to tune this in your organization and can offer some real-world experiences, please provide feedback!</p><p>There are three thresholds in this particular search.<ol><li>In the first, we look for connections that last longer than 60 seconds. Most web servers that expect return traffic will keep connections open for prolonged periods of time to improve performance and reduce utilization on their load balancers. In testing, this seems to filter out some advertising.</li><li>For the second filter, we look in a single hour for where there are at least 30 different connections. Thirty different connections lasting longer than a minute indicates a very heavy amount of activity in that hour.</li><li>Finally we count how many hours have that amount of activity over the last week (specifically, looking for at least 20 hours of heavy activity).</li></ol></p><p>Again, we would love to get feedback on the viability of this rule based on real-world experience.</p>",

In this example we show three different methods for pulling lists of users: querying LDAP, querying a database, or looking for users who take the actions that a privileged user would take. Let's walk through these examples. <ul><li>Pulling from LDAP - there are three different approaches for pulling from LDAP. We generally recommend that most users start by using the Supporting Add-on for Active Directory (aka SA-ldapsearch) which provides the ldapsearch command. This command is native in Splunk, and works great for on premises installations in organizations with fewer than 50,000 users (<a href=\"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1151/\" target=\"_blank\">app link</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SA-LdapSearch/2.1.6/User/AbouttheSplunkSupportingAdd-onforActiveDirectory\" target=\"_blank\">docs link</a>). You can also pull data using AD Monitor, which is the Splunk Universal Forwarder's ability to monitor Active Directory for changes -- recommended for large organizations, and for Cloud environments (<a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Data/MonitorActiveDirectory\" target=\"_blank\">doc link</a>). Finally, it is sometimes simpler to use Powershell for this effort (<a href=\"https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Powershell-script-to-5edcdaea\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>).</li><li>Organizations with formal systems for managing privileged users that don't sync to Active Directory will most frequently need to pull a list of users by querying a database (though sometimes an API is available). This frequently occurs when you have an on-prem software application backed by a database that stores a list of privileged users. The process you will walk through to pull that data into Splunk is to first discover the username and password to log into the database along with the query that will return your desired set of users, and then configure Splunk DB Connect (<a href=\"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2686/\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DBX/latest\">doc link</a>) to pull that data. Learning the credentials and the required query is sometimes very easy, and sometimes very difficult, but often you will be able to find help from Splunk Professional Services or on <a href=\"https://answers.splunk.com/\">Splunk Answers</a>.</li><li>Finally, we can always infer a list of privileged users by finding users who take privileged actions. There are many ways to approach this process, but the simplest is by searching for the use of tag=privileged  on authentication events, as defined by the Splunk Common Information Model.</li></ul></p><p>Now we've discussed how to ingest the data in the first place -- but we haven't discussed what data we actually should be ingesting. There are two primary categories of privileged users that we might want to monitor: those who have administrative rights, and those that are privileged. <ul><li>Those who have administrative rights is a very simple question to answer in a smaller organization, but exponentially more difficult with the complexity of the environment. It's best to start with standard privileged AD groups, such as Domain Admins, and then expand into environment-specific groups, such as the custom help desk admin group that had local admin rights on all workstations (every company has at least one of these). It's often easiest to find these types of groups by hunting through LDAP for key terms such as \"*admin*\" or \"*operator*\" etc. Finally, wrap up by searching for users with specific admin rights, such as privileged service accounts and see what groups (if any) they belong to. It's generally advisable to look for known administrative users across the organization (either specific names, or by naming scheme such as jsmith-a) and seeing which groups these users belong to.</li><li>Generally speaking, understanding VIP users in an organization can be dramatically easier than finding all admin accounts. Title will frequently get you all you need, though you may also find that tracking the # of steps away from the CEO based on reporting structure can be very effective. It's important to not forget employees that are associated with highly visible people but aren't themselves as visible, particularly the executive assistants for all your important users. They generally have full access to an exec's calendar, mailboxes, and more often than we would like they will also have a text file somewhere on their computer with the executive's password (or similar).</li></ul></p>",

Salesforce is an example of a CRM business application which is used to store and process personal data relating to customers, partners, prospects and often employees. As part of a Salesforce.com deployment, other applications interact with this sensitive data, via push or pull APIs that automate data exchange - for example integrations into finance and human resources applications such as Workday, or marketing automation tools such as Eloqua and Marketo. Attackers can attempt to use the Salesforce.com API as a vector to gain access to sensitive data. Because Salesforce.com is a cloud application with a publicly accessible domain, this vector only requires valid credentials, and can be exploited for access to sensitive data by adversaries, even if they lack access to internal resources.</p><h4>Impact:</h4><p>Under the GDPR Article 30, organizations are required to maintain a record of processing activities including contact details of the controller, the purposes of processing, description of the categories of data subjects and personal data processed -- as well as the categories of recipients to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed including recipients in any other countries. Interactions from new applications -- whether for legitimate purposes or as a result of malicious activity -- can create a non-compliance condition if they are not documented properly. This situation may not impact organizations who employ fewer than 250 persons and therefore may not have critical categories of personal data for processing.</p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p>Monitoring Salesforce.com API activity can help identify connections from new applications or clients that might not be whitelisted or documented.

It's also one of the searches in SSE where the live version is way simpler than the demo version, because we can take advantage of simple keyword searching.</p><p>There are three phases to this search. <ul><li>First we run a subsearch to collect a list of filenames from a CSV file (also called a lookup) that contains a list of tools that are labeled as discovery, attacker, suspicious. If you've never used a subsearch before, the basic idea is that you take a search that works on its own, usually one that returns just one column. When you put brackets around that and add it into a new search, Splunk will run the subsearch first, take those columns and add them to the main search. For example, if your subsearch had a single field called \"name\" with a value \"David\", name=\"David\" would be added into your main search. If it returned two rows, and the second row had \"name\" with the value \"John\", then the main search would use (name=\"David\" OR name=\"John\"). They're pretty simple once you get used to them. For more info, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.1/SearchTutorial/Useasubsearch\">docs</a>, or explore <a href=\"https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAPX9\">Free Splunk Training</a>.</li>\n<li>Next we search in our process launch logs for any of those filenames. This is straightforward Splunk searching.</li><li>Finally, the other fancy part of this search is using the transaction command. Transaction takes all the logs in and groups them together by whatever field you specify, in this case host. So functionally, we are grouping together all the process launches for attacker tools (since we already filtered for them) per host. Transaction can be slow with really big datasets, but it works great for relatively small datasets like this. It also has tons of knobs and levers -- check out the <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/transaction\">docs</a> for more. </li></ul>",

Threat activity detected can represent a range of potential security issues that may be unpredictable and difficult to know how to handle \u2013 in the above example, it may not be clear whether the communication is simply beaconing or sensitive data is being exfiltrated.</p><h4>Impact:</h4><p>Early detection of threat activity is critical to effective and timely response. This is a security best practice.</p><p>Specific to the GDPR, organizations must collect the full audit trail of data processing activities of involved systems and applications, and document, investigate, and report any data breach. Threat activity indicates a potential breach and therefore high-risk situation for personal data. Detection and awareness of threat activity is critical to respond in a timely manner, within the 72-hr deadline of GDPR, as well as to maintain compliance requirements of GDPR. If detection indicates a condition of high risk and non-compliance, then it needs to be documented, remediated, and potentially investigated and reported. Lacking the ability to detect personal data can impact the organization via a wide array of GDPR articles, including Article 15 (individuals have the right to ask an organization where their data is stored); proving that only authorized individuals have accessed personal data (Article 28), and documenting and reporting unauthorized access to the data privacy authorities; regularly testing, assessing and evaluating effectiveness of implemented technical and organizational security controls (Article 32); and demonstrating compliance within the scope of a privacy audit (Article 58); maintaining a record of processing activities (Article 30); ensuring legitimate access and lawful intended use and processing (Article 6); verifying and proving erasure of data (Article 17); restricting the processing of personal data to a limited set of reasons (Article 18 and Article 21); compliance to right of access requirements including by contractors or sub-processors (Article 15); compliance to subject rights regarding automated decision making processes (Article 22); </p><p>If the organization faces a personal data breach, potential impact includes reporting within the 72-hr deadline with full context of what happened within the incident, as well as proving to individuals demanding compensation that the organizations has understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (Article 82); and Article 33 requires organizations to inform the authorities, including details about the nature of the breach -- the same requirement exists within Article 34, that organizations must identify which individuals are affected.</p>",

            "howToImplement": "<p>There are two primary triggers for this search -- one is the categories being excluded, and the other is the number of denies that you want to trigger on. There is no standard best practice for either of these, so you can adjust these values to be whatever makes sense for your organization. The most common way we hear of this detection being described is to target suspicious internal users, so most organizations will adjust the filters to look for Acceptable Use Policy violations (e.g., browsing gambling sites) as opposed to denies that are tied to security hygiene (e.g., phishing). That said, you could absolutely implement it in both directions if you so desired. The threshold for triggering would likely be different between those categories though, as a human will likely quit relatively early when they see deny messages versus a script that gets timeouts instead of a big error message.</p><p><b>If this searches creates too many false positives in your environment</b>, it may be because some of your users just generate a very large number of proxy denies on a regular basis. The first bet for dealing with this would be basic tuning of the categories you alert on. If that is not sufficient, you can instead implement this as a per-user time series detection. Look for the # of unauthorized detections per day per user, and then alert when any user exceeds their baseline. You can base this on any of the time series detections in Splunk Security Essentials -- a common and easy one would be to look at <a href=\"/app/Splunk_Security_Essentials/showcase_standard_deviation?ml_toolkit.dataset=Increase in Interactive Logons - Demo\" target=\"_blank\">Increase in Interactive Logons</a> (just swap out the field names and base dataset and implementation will be easy). There's one important adjustment you would need in order to make that work for you though -- because most users don't see proxy denies often, most of your users will end up with very low averages and low standard deviations. To guard against this, in addition to tracking that the most recent # of denies per day is more than 3 (or 6, or whatever) stdev above the average, you should also make sure that the most recent # is more than 5 (or 10, or whatever). That way you don't accidentally alert on a user that just had one deny (no matter how anomalous a deny is for that user).</p>",
